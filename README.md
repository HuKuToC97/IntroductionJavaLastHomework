My homework "Looking for a laptop."
What needed to be done:
  Think about the structure of the Laptop class for a hardware store - highlight the fields and methods. Implement in java.
  Create many laptops.
  Write a method that will ask the user for a filtering criterion (or criteria) and display laptops that match the filter. Filtering criteria can be stored in a Map.
  For example:
    â€œEnter the number that meets the required criterion:
      1 - RAM
      2 - Volume of railway
      3 - Operating system
      4 - Color...
      5 - Search
  Next, you need to request the minimum values for the specified criteria - you can also save the filtering parameters in Map.
  Filter laptops from the initial set and display those passing according to the conditions.
  Submit your work as usual with a link to the git repository
  Common mistakes:
    1. Force the user to enter all existing filtering criteria
    2. It is not possible to use more than one filter criteria at the same time
    3. When selecting, laptops are displayed that satisfy only one filter, and not all entered by the user
    4. The work was performed only for some specific laptops, and if you change the characteristics of the laptops or add another laptop, the program begins to work incorrectly
